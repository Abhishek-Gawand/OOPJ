Q. BMI Calculator
You have been asked to write a Java program to implement a BMI (Body Mass
Index) calculator. The program should have the following functionality:
The BMI calculator class should have the following fields:
a. height: A double field to store the height of the person in meters.
b. weight: A double field to store the weight of the person in kilograms.
The BMI calculator class should have the following methods:
a. A constructor to initialize the height and weight fields of the BMI calculator
object.
b. Getter and setter methods.
c. Double calculateBMI(): A method to calculate the BMI of the person using the
following formula:
BMI = weight / (height * height).
Write a Java program that creates an object of the BMI calculator class, prompts the
user to input their height and weight, sets the height and weight fields of the BMI
calculator object using the setter methods, calculates the BMI using the
calculateBMI() method, and prints the calculated BMI to the console.

=
class BmiCalculator{

double height;   //instance variable
double weight;

public double BmiCalculator(double height, double weight){  //constructor
this.height=height;
this.weight=weight;
return 0;
}

public void setHeight(double height){  //setter for height
this.height=height;
}

public double getHeight(){  //getter for height
return height;
}

public void setWeight(double weight){    //setter for weight
this.weight=weight;    
}

public double getWeight(){    //getter for weight
return weight;
}

public double calculateBMI(double height, double weight){    //method for calculation
double BMI;
BMI=weight/(height*height);
System.out.println("BMI : "+BMI);
return BMI;
}

public static void main(String []args){    //main method
BmiCalculator bmi = new BmiCalculator();    //object
bmi.calculateBMI(1768,84);	

}
}

Q. Create a class named "ElectricityBill" that has the following instance variables:
a. customerName (String)
b. unitsConsumed (double)
c. billAmount (double)
Create a constructor that initializes the customerName and unitsConsumed instance
variables.
Define a method named "calculateBillAmount" that calculates the bill amount based
on the number of units consumed. The formula for calculating the bill amount is:
a. For the first 100 units: Rs. 5 per unit
b. For the next 200 units: Rs. 7 per unit
c. For the remaining units: Rs. 10 per unit
Implement the "calculateBillAmount" method in the "ElectricityBill" class.
Define a main method that creates an object of the "ElectricityBill" class and sets the
customerName and unitsConsumed instance variables. Then, call the
"calculateBillAmount" method to calculate the bill amount and display the
customerName, unitsConsumed, and billAmount.
=
class Bill{

String customerName;
double unitsConsumed;
double billAmount;

public Bill(String customerName, double unitsConsumed)  //constructor
{
this.customerName = customerName;
this.unitsConsumed = unitsConsumed;

}

public void calculateBillAmount(){

if (unitsConsumed<=100)
{
billAmount=unitsConsumed*5;
System.out.println("Bill Amount : "+billAmount);
}

else if (unitsConsumed>100 && unitsConsumed<=200)
{
billAmount=unitsConsumed*7;
System.out.println("Bill Amount : "+billAmount);
}

else
{
billAmount=unitsConsumed*10;
System.out.println("Bill Amount : "+billAmount);
}
}

public static void main(String args[]){

Bill bill = new Bill();

bill.calculateBillAmount("Amit",250);

}
}

Q. Accept date and time from user. You are required to write a Java program to convert
dates and times between different formats.
The program should be able to convert dates between the following formats:
a. dd/mm/yyyy (e.g., 31/12/2022)
=
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;

class TimeDate{
	
public static void main(String args[]) {
		
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/mm/yyyy");
		
Date date = new Date();
		
String formattedDate = sdf.format(date);
	
System.out.println(formattedDate);
	
	}	
	
}
